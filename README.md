#Drun-Kit
##The Drum Kit project is an interactive web application allowing users to play drum sounds by clicking buttons or pressing keys (w, a, s, d, j, k, l). Each input triggers a specific drum sound with visual feedback. The project employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and engaging user experience.
